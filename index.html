            <p>I was Born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2002. <br> I grew up
            and went to school there. After finishing high school I
            moved to Cape Town to stay with my grandmother, while there I took a sailing course
            and got my Yacht-Masther's skipper license with a plan of working overseas 
            and doing a few charters and possibly some deliveries. <br> I decided to put that on hold in the mean while
            to try and gain some extra skills in case sailing wouldn't work out. <br> I had always been interested in the latest and 
            greatest of technology and so it was only natural I was drawn to coding and developing. <br> I started with Python and progressed quickly.
            However my heart became set on different things and I missed the visual design aspect of building programes.<br> A few articles and experimenting later 
            and here we are, I love CSS and my previous experience with Python helped with the thinking and manouvering behind JavaScript.<br> 
            So far I have enjoyed the journey and only hope it doesn't end yet.<br>
